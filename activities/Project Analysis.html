			<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
			<p>The main objective for this project is to redesign the UI to increase readability, organize the content into relevant pages, and implement a mobile first approach. Also, we need to condense the site down to six (6) pages: index, FAQ, services, coupons, service area, contact. Currently every page of the site has validation errors, and the global navigation is buggy and doesn't load at all on some pages.  </p>
			<p>I plan to achieve this by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Updating the site to semantically correct HTML5 and CSS3.</li>
				 	<li>Choosing a color pallet that enhances readability</li>
				 </ul>

			<h2>Targeted Audience:</h2>
			<p>After reviewing competitor's websites and reviews on www.yelp.com, I have determined that the target audience falls primarily into two categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="float">Males, Age 18-24, who have no children, little or no collage education and primarily browse from work or school.  </li>
				<li class="float">Males, age 35-44, who have children, some collage and primarily browse from work.</li>
			</ul>
